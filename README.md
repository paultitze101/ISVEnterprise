# ISV Enterprise

Virtual build of a starship for an exploratory scientific mission to survey the surface of the known exoplanet [Proxima Centauri b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_b). Distance: 4.2 ly. Crew complement: 100. The mission will allow most of the crew to be able to return to Earth within their lifetimes except for more mature volunteer crew who might need to sign a waiver however cryosleep may also be an option.

This author will be using a combination of KSP 1.12.5 with mods and imported custom made starship parts modelled in Blender to assist with visualisations (see Part 1 of this article if you're not familiar with KSP). Note that this author is also keeping a close eye on developments of Kitten Space Agency (KSA) which is the spiritual successor to KSP2 with some of the original KSP developers working on this new space simulation game. More significantly KSA will also have interstellar travel.
