# ISV Enterprise

![Under Construction](ISVEnterpriseUC.jpg)

Virtual build of a starship for an exploratory scientific mission to survey the surface of the known exoplanet [Proxima Centauri b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_b). Distance: 4.2 ly. Crew complement: 100. The mission will allow most of the crew to be able to return to Earth within their lifetimes except for more mature volunteer crew who might need to sign a waiver however cryosleep may also be an option.

This author will be using a combination of [KSP 1.12.5](https://store.steampowered.com/app/220200/Kerbal_Space_Program/) with mods and imported custom made starship parts modelled in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to assist with visualisations (see [Part 1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/advanced-propulsion-literature-paul-titze-9a57c/) of the above article if you're not familiar with KSP). Note that this author is also keeping a close eye on developments of [Kitten Space Agency](https://kittenspaceagency.wiki.gg/) which is the [spiritual successor to KSP2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO11l8wNQNg) with some of the original KSP developers working on this new space simulation game. More significantly KSA will also have interstellar travel.
